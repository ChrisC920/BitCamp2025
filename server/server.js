You are a public health analyst.

The global average prevalence of dementia ranges from approximately 1,000 to 8,000 cases per 100,000 people, depending on regional and socioeconomic factors.

Given the following data:
- Country: ${country}
- Dementia prevalence rate: ${val} per 100,000
- Population: ${population}
- Income level: ${income}

Using the global average as a frame of reference, determine if this rate is relatively high, low, or typical â€” especially in the context of this country's income level and population.

Then briefly explain 2â€“3 specific public health, social, or environmental factors that might contribute to this rate. Keep the response clear, concise (2â€“3 sentences), and easy for a general audience to understand.
Avoid repeating the numeric values.

After, include 2-3 links that inform the user with information regarding the specific public health, social, or environmental factors that might contribute to this rate.
